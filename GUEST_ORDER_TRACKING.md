# Guest Order Tracking System

## Overview
This document explains how guest users can track their orders and view order history without creating an account. The system provides full order tracking functionality for both guest and registered users.

---

## 🔍 **How Guest Order Tracking Works**

### **1. Order Creation**
- **Guest Orders**: Created with `user_id: null` in the database
- **Email Storage**: Guest email stored in `shipping_address.email`
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order
- **Same Database**: Guest and registered orders use the same tables

### **2. Order Tracking Methods**

#### **Method 1: Email-Based Search**
- **How it works**: Search all guest orders by email address
- **Use case**: Find all orders placed with a specific email
- **Security**: Only shows orders with matching email

#### **Method 2: Order ID Search**
- **How it works**: Direct search by order ID
- **Use case**: Track a specific order
- **Security**: Order ID is unique and acts as a key

## 🛠️ **Implementation Details**

### **Database Schema**
```sql
-- Orders table supports both guest and registered users
orders:
  - id: UUID (Primary Key)
  - user_id: UUID (NULL for guest orders)
  - total_amount: DECIMAL
  - status: ENUM
  - shipping_address: JSONB (includes email for guests)
  - created_at: TIMESTAMP

-- Order items linked to orders regardless of user type
order_items:
  - id: UUID
  - order_id: UUID (Foreign Key to orders)
  - product_id: UUID
  - quantity: INTEGER
  - price: DECIMAL
```

### **Guest Order Tracking Page** (`/track-order`)
- **Search by Email**: Find all orders with specific email
- **Search by Order ID**: Find specific order
- **Order History**: View all past orders
- **Order Details**: Full order information including items and shipping

### **Order Success Page** (Updated)
- **Works for both**: Guest and registered users
- **Dynamic Actions**: Different buttons based on user type
- **Guest Users**: "Track Your Orders" button
- **Registered Users**: "View All Orders" button
