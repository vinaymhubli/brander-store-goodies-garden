# Guest Checkout Implementation

## Overview
The Brander Store now supports **Guest Checkout** functionality, allowing customers to purchase products without creating an account. This feature significantly improves conversion rates by removing the registration barrier.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Guest Cart System**
- **Local Storage**: Guest cart items are stored in browser's localStorage
- **Persistence**: Cart persists across browser sessions
- **Sync on Login**: Guest cart automatically syncs to user account when they log in

### 2. **Updated Cart Hook (`useCart.ts`)**
- **Dual Mode**: Works for both authenticated users and guests
- **Guest Functions**: 
  - `loadGuestCart()` - Loads cart from localStorage
  - `saveGuestCart()` - Saves cart to localStorage
  - Guest cart operations (add, remove, update quantity, clear)

### 3. **Guest Checkout Flow**
- **No Authentication Required**: Users can proceed to checkout without login
- **Email Collection**: Email field added to shipping form for guest orders
- **Order Processing**: Orders are created with `user_id: null` for guests

### 4. **Updated Navigation**
- **Optional Login**: Shows "Sign In" or "Shop as Guest" options
- **Clear Messaging**: Users understand they can shop without account

### 5. **Edge Functions Updated**
- **`create-razorpay-order`**: Handles both authenticated and guest users
- **`verify-payment-and-create-order`**: Creates orders with optional user_id
- **Guest Order Support**: Orders can be created without user authentication

## User Experience Flow

### Guest User Journey:
1. **Browse Products** - No login required
2. **Add to Cart** - Items stored in localStorage
3. **View Cart** - Full cart functionality without login
4. **Checkout** - Fill shipping details including email
5. **Payment** - Complete payment with Razorpay
6. **Order Confirmation** - Receive order details via email

### Logged-in User Journey:
1. **Browse Products** - Same as guest
2. **Add to Cart** - Items stored in database
3. **View Cart** - Full cart functionality with persistence
4. **Checkout** - Pre-filled with user details
5. **Payment** - Complete payment with Razorpay
6. **Order Confirmation** - Order linked to user account

## Technical Implementation

### Cart Management:
```typescript
// Guest cart operations
if (!user) {
  // Handle guest cart in localStorage
  const updatedItems = cartItems.map(item => 
    item.id === itemId ? { ...item, quantity } : item
  );
  setCartItems(updatedItems);
  saveGuestCart(updatedItems);
  return;
}
```

### Database Schema:
- **Orders Table**: `user_id` can be `null` for guest orders
- **Order Items**: Linked to orders regardless of user status
- **Cart Items**: Only for authenticated users

### Edge Functions:
- **Authentication Optional**: Functions work with or without user
- **Guest Order Creation**: Orders created with `user_id: null`
- **Payment Processing**: Same Razorpay integration for all users

## Benefits

### For Customers:
- ✅ **Faster Checkout** - No registration required
- ✅ **Reduced Friction** - Immediate purchase capability

- ✅ **Seamless Experience** - Same functionality as logged-in users

### For Business:

## Configuration

### Environment Variables:
```bash
# Required for payment processing
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_key_secret

# Supabase configuration

```

### Database Updates:

## Testing Guest Checkout

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Guest Purchase**: Add items → Checkout → Pay → Receive confirmation
2. **Login After Guest Cart**: Add items as guest → Login → Cart syncs
3. **Mixed Users**: Test both guest and logged-in flows
4. **Cart Persistence**: Refresh page, cart should persist for guests
5. **Order Tracking**: Verify guest orders are created properly

### Expected Behavior:
- Guest users can complete full purchase flow
- Cart persists in localStorage
- Orders are created with proper guest identification
- Email notifications work for guest orders
- Login after guest cart syncs items to user account

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
- **Guest Order Tracking**: Allow guests to track orders via email
- **Account Creation**: Option to create account after guest purchase
- **Wishlist for Guests**: Temporary wishlist in localStorage
- **Guest Checkout Analytics**: Track guest vs registered conversions
